# Multiple-linear-regression-model
Using Machine learning algorithm build a simple linear regression model by performing EDA and do necessary transformations and select the best model using Python.
1. Create a simple linear regression model to predict mpg based on weight.
2. Create a simple linear regression model to predict the Delivery time using Sorting time.
